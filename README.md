# JBWAPI

Pure Java [bwapi](https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi) 4.4.0 client implementation backed by [N00byEdge](https://github.com/N00byEdge)'s [JavaBWAPIBackend](https://github.com/N00byEdge/JavaBWAPIBackend) idea and automated by [Bytekeeper](https://github.com/Bytekeeper).

Also contains a modified version of the pure Java BWEM implementation from [BWAPI4J](https://github.com/OpenBW/BWAPI4J).

## Goals

 - Have a similar (Java) interface to BWMirror to make porting BWMirror bots easy without all the DLL and JNI hassle and overhead.
 - Stay as updated as possible with the BWAPI releases.

## Advantages

 - No dependency on external DLL's.
 - At least [5x](https://github.com/JavaBWAPI/JBWAPI/issues/17) faster compared to BWMirror for primitives as it directly reads the memory mapped client file. Even faster for BWAPI objects as it also avoids type marshalling
 - Supports both 32 and 64 bit Java (e.g. [deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/) requires 64 bit Java which bwmirror doesn't support).
 - BWEM instead of BWTA as map analyser.

## Warnings
 - A fake BWTA is provided for easier porting from BWMirror, but it translates BWTA calls to their respective BWEM calls, so specific Regions/Chokepoints etc. may differ.

## Usage

**Maven**

Add JitPack as a repository:
```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
Add JBWAPI as a dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.JavaBWAPI</groupId>
    <artifactId>JBWAPI</artifactId>
    <version>1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**

Add JitPack as a repository:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Add JBWAPI as a dependency:
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.JavaBWAPI:JBWAPI:1.2'
}
```

**Jar**

Alternatively add the latest .jar from the [releases](https://github.com/JavaBWAPI/JBWAPI/releases) page to your project.

## Compilation

`mvnw.cmd package`

or if you already have maven installed

`mvn package`

## Example

A simple `Hello World` bot is as easy as

```Java
import bwapi.*;

class HelloBot extends DefaultBWListener {
	private BWClient bwClient;

	@Override
	public void onFrame() {
		Game game = bwClient.getGame();
		game.drawTextScreen(100, 100, "Hello World!");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		HelloBot bot = new HelloBot();
		bot.bwClient = new BWClient(bot);
		bot.bwClient.startGame();
	}
}
```
